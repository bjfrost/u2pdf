u2pdf is a command line utility roughly based upon a2ps that
generates a PDF file reflecting the contents of the input file.
Command line options can be used to remove headings or page
borders or to number the input file lines, or change the
page style (portrait, landscape or 2-up).

This tool is particularly useful when the input file contains
UTF-8 characters such as an APL source file.

This tool is written in python using the cairo, pango and
pangocairo modules to produce the output file.
